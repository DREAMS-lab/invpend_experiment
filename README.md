# Inverted Pendulum Experiment
* Author: LinZHank
> Using gazebo to simulate inverted pendulum and control through ROS

## How to use it
> My configuration was Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS-Kinetic
1.
2. cd to the '/src' directory in ROS workspace \(e.g. 'cd ~/ros_ws/src'\)
3. 'git clone https://github.com/linZHank/invpend_experiment.git'
4. 'catkin_make', or 'carkin build' if you were using [Catkin Command Line Tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

> The URDF model of the inverted pendulum and gazebo model spawn were refered to [this tutorial](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_urdf&cat=connect_ros)
